Hi, 
Traffic Sign Recogniton as the name suggests, detects traffic signs from a natural scene image and classifies the traffic sign.

Input and Output: A video - in_vid.mp4 [Signs are detected from the video , classified into respective class and writes in on the video]

Three main compoenents:
1. Pre-processing: PreProcessing.py 
2. Detection: Detection.py
3. Classification:
  a) classification_model_training.py : Convolutional neural network training with German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset. this creates the classification.hs file which is the trained model that is to be imported in the main code.
  b) classification.py: classification of the detected sign
  
Main file to be run: TSDCM.py
